# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Project written whilst learning python during a pedagogical study of coding tutorials.

## Set Up
The program is by using `python rock_paper_scissors` in the terminal.

## Run
The program prompts you for a choice of either 'r', 'p', or 's' in a self-explanatory manner. 
Once the choice has been entered, the program will then reveal the results of the game.
